includeRule can be "include" or "exclude".
	include means include the fields listed in the region.
	exclude means include all fields not listed in the region AND not listed in the exclusionCorrespondingRegion.

includeTime is true or false and says whether to include the time component of date fields.
	It can be overridden at the Field level.

		One future tweak is to improve the way the fields get ordered here. Right now
		they'll just come out the same order as in the export, which will likely be semi-random.
