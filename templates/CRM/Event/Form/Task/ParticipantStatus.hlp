{ts}If you are moving participants from "On waitlist" to "Pending from waitlist" status, make sure there are available
spaces for the event. An email with a link to confirm their registration will be automatically sent. However, they
will only be allowed to complete their registration if the event is not full (e.g. the number of registered participants
is less than the maximum number of participants configured for the event).{/ts}
