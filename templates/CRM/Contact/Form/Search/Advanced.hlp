    <p>{ts}Use <strong>%</strong> wildcard(s) for partial matches (other than contact name/email). EXAMPLE: Enter "Volunteer%" as your Activity Type to match any activity whose type is "Volunteer" + any other words (e.g. Volunteer for Open House).{/ts}</p>
    <p>{ts}If multiple boxes are checked for Contact Types, Groups, Tags and Location Types, the selections are combined as <strong>OR</strong> criteria (e.g. checking &quot;Group A&quot; and &quot;Group B&quot; will find contacts who are either in &quot;Group A&quot; OR &quot;Group B&quot;).
            All other search fields are combined as <strong>AND</strong> criteria (e.g. selecting Tag is &quot;Major Donor&quot; AND Country is &quot;Mexico&quot; returns only those contacts who meet both criteria).{/ts}</p>
