<h1>{ts}Scheduling and Sending Mailings{/ts}</h1>
<p>
    {ts}You can schedule mailings to be sent starting at a specific date and time, OR you
    can request that they be sent as soon as possible by checking &quot;Send Immediately&quot;.{/ts}
</p>
<p>
    {ts}Clicking <strong>Done</strong> adds this mailing to the mailing queue. An automated task which
    runs periodically on your server processes mailings in the queue, and starts actually sending
    out your mail.{/ts}
</p>
<p>
    {ts 1="http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence//x/vyM" 2=$docURLTitle}<strong>Trouble-shooting Tip</strong> - If you find that your mailings are not being sent, ask
    the system administrator or technical support contact for your site to verify that the automated
    task (&quot;cron job&quot;) is running - and how frequently. (<a href="%1" title="%2" target="_blank">more info...</a>){/ts}
