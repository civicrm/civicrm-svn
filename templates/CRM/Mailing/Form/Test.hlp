<p>
{ts}It's a good idea to test your mailing by sending it to yourself and/or a selected group of people in your organization.
You can also view your content by clicking (+) Preview Mailing.{/ts}
<p>
{ts}Verify the test email address and/or test recipient group. Then click <strong>Next</strong> with
&quot;Send Test Mailing&quot; checked to generate the test mailing. Once you receive the test mailing:
<ul>
<li>Verify the content and formattting.</li>
<li>If you are using mail-merge tokens, check that they have been replaced with expected values.</li>
<li>Click on each included link to make sure they go to the expected web pages.</li>
</ul>
If you need to make changes, you can click <strong>Previous</strong>
from the next screen, and again from this screen to return to step 3.
After making your changes, you can send another test and repeat as needed.{/ts}
