<p>{ts}This setting forces a redirect of all online contribution page requests to SSL secured URLs (https).{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}If you use a payment processor service where credit card and billing information is collected ON YOUR SITE (PayPal Website Payments Pro or Moneris as of now)
<strong>it is strongly recommended that you create or obtain an SSL certificate and configure your webserver to support SSL connections</strong>. Consult your
hosting provider or web-server documentation for more information on obtaining and installing SSL certificates.{/ts}</p>
<p>{ts}Once you have your certificate installed, test that is working by navigating to one of your online contribution pages and changing the URL prefix from
'http://' to 'https://'. If your browser loads the page and indicates a valid security certificate - then you can change this setting to <strong>Yes</strong>
and CiviCRM will automatically redirect requests for all online contribution pages to the corresponding SSL secured URLs.{/ts}</p>
