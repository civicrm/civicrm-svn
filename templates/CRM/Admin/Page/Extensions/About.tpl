This page will automatically list the available "native" extensions from the <a href="%3" target="_blank">CiviCRM.org extensions directory</a> which are compatible with this version of CiviCRM. If you install Custom Searches, Reports or Payment Processor extensions - these will automatically be available on the corresponding menus and screens. You may also want to check the <a href="%3" target="_blank">extensions directory</a> for native %2 modules that may be useful for you (CMS-specific modules are not listed here).{/ts}</p>
