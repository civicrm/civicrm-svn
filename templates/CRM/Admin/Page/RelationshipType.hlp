    <p>{ts}<strong>Special Relationships</strong><br />Employee <-> Employer and Household relationships both have special characteristics.<br /><strong>Employee <-> Employer relationship</strong> is created anytime the 'Current Employer' field is filled in, either in the Contact Summary form or via a Profile. When filled in, it will create an Organisation if one does not already exist with that name.<br /><strong>Household relationship</strong> enables household members to have the 'household address' applied to their record. Again, if a Household already exists then the individual will have a relationship created with it, if none exists then a new household will be created.{/ts}
