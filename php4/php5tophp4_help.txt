Instructions for setting up crm in PHP- 4 

cd ~/svn/privrepos/kurund/trunk/
mkdir php4
cd php4
copy CRM, api, modules folders from you  crm folder
cp -R  /~svn/crm/CRM  .
cp -R  /~svn/crm/modules  .
cp -R  /~svn/crm/api  .

remove all .svn folder from all the copied folders

created the symbolic links in php4/crm
run the script createlinks.sh
 
setup the crm and check if  it works on under php 5.

After that run same crm under php 4. (it should give some error)

use the /~svn/crm/bin/converter.php  to converter php5 to php4

currently only *.php file can be converted to php4

Using converter you can convert single file or entire folder. (instructions are in the script)
eg:
- for single file coversion:
 php converter.php  php5filename > php4filename

for converting entire folder
php converter.php


using convertor convert  CRM, api  and modules folder. 
note: file that donot have .php extension  should be converted manually.(single file).
