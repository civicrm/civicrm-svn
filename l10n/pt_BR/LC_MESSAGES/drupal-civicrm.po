"The CiviCRM module stores information on the universe of people associated "
"with a community and on their interactions such as emails, donations, "
"petitions, events, etc. It can act as a stand alone contact management "
"system or it can be integrated with mass mailer, volunteer management, "
"petition, and event finding. CiviCRM enables organizations to maintain all "
"these activities in a single database, creating efficiencies and new "
"opportunities for communities to better communicate and benefit from "
"relationships with their community members."

"The CiviCRM module allows you to create contacts, or import them from other "
"sources. You can record relationships between contacts, such as indicating "
"they live in the same household. There are two types of groups of contacts. "
"You can create static groups which have a set list of contacts. You can also "
"create dynamic (smart) groups based on characteristics that contacts have in "
"common. For example, you could create a group of all contacts who live in "
"California AND who have volunteered for your organization within the past "
"year. The CiviCRM module also allows for tagging for less formal "
"categorization of contacts or groups. You can easily extend CiviCRM to "
"record community member information which is specific to your community or "
"organization using custom fields. For example, you can create a set of "
"fields to track volunteer skills and preferences. CiviCRM profile gives you "
"a way to allow community members ('users') to update their own information, "
"as well as share some of that information with others. Finally, you can "
"configure custom activity types such as volunteering or attending events."
