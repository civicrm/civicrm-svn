.SH DESCRIPTION
.B amavisd
is a high-performance interface between message transfer
agent (MTA) and virus scanners and/or spam scanners.
.PP
This is the amavisd-new incarnation of amavisd.  It is a performance-enhanced
and feature-enriched version of the original amavisd program.
.PP
Amavisd-new works as a SMTP proxy.  Email is fed to it through SMTP, processed,
and fed back to the MTA through a new SMTP connection.  There is no buffering
to disk by amavis, it will report that the transfer was sucessfull only after
the forwarding MTA has accepted the message.
.PP
It is possible to use the sendmail milter interface instead of the SMTP
proxy method, as well.
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
