The Debian packaging of amavisd-new is:
  Copyright (c) 2002-2004 by Brian May <bam@debian.org>
  Copyright (c) 2003-2004 by Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>
  and distributed in the same license as the upstream source it applies to.

Upstream sources are at http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/

Upstream Authors: Mark Martinec <mark.martinec@ijs.si>, and others.

There are lots of different versions of amavis.
According to Luca Filipozzi <lfilipoz@debian.org>:

amavis-perl : the original (slow) one
amavisd     : the client/server version
amavis-ng   : Hilko Bengen's rewrite of amavis-perl/amavisd
amavisd-new : Marc Martinec's version

This version is amavisd-new.  We have renamed it to amavisd-new to avoid
clashes with other packages.
