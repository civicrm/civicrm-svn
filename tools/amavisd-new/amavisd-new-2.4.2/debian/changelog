  * New upstream version:
    + new feature: "pen pals soft-whitelisting" lowers spam score of
      received replies to a message previously sent by a local user to this
      address
    + new features: added command line options to override certain
      configuration settings from a config file
    + documentation bug fixes, specially on the use of SQL data type
      TIMESTAMP
    + zoo decoder interface routine can now use utility unzoo(1) or
      zoo(1)
    + LDAP schema change: amavisSpamSubjectTag renamed to
      amavisSpamQuarantineCutoffLevel
    + Many bug fixes, including:
      + Issue fixed: a message with only a header, without empty
        separator line and with no body, lost the last line of a header on
        forwarding or writing to quarantine (closes: #373206)
      + use stricter suggested regular expression in amavisd.conf for
        matching CLSID (Class ID extension); previous expression was loose
        and too easily matched file names with braces in the name
        (closes: #373159)
  * NEWS.Debian: make it even more clear to whom the incompatible changes
    apply, and point user to the upstream documentation about it instead of
    describing the incompatible changes.  Apply NEWS blurb to 1:2.4.2-1, so
    that it is shown again to the users (closes: #373136)
  * conf.d/25-amavis_helpers: (brown paperback bug): fix location of control
    socket
  * New amavisd-new-cronjob script (with manpage) to encapsulate cronjobs
  * amavisd-new.cron.d, amavisd-new.cron.daily: use the new

amavisd-new (1:2.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source
    + Courier patch requires Net::Server 0.90 or later (not used in Debian
      by default)
    + Fixed many bugs
    + Address extension is back to 2.3.3 semanthics (done at tag2_level)
    + Fixed error handling during temporary directory cleanups
    + Added config variables: @spam_subject_tag3_maps, @spam_tag3_level_maps
      (and $sa_tag3_level_deflt), see upstream documentation for specifics
    + Added LDAP attributes: amavisSpamSubjectTag, amavisSpamSubjectTag2,
      amavisSpamDsnCutoffLevel, amavisSpamQuarantineCutoffLevel
    + Changed notification templates in an incompatible way with 2.4.0
      (still compatible to 2.3.3 and older): major contents category numbers
      are renumbered due to a newly inserted category CC_SPAMMY; it affects
      the use of macro ccat_maj in templates
    + Storing mail in BSMTP format now saves DSN information, as permitted
      by RFC 2442
    + Apply the concept of separate timers $child_timeout and $smtpd_timeout
      as used in a SMTP session to AM.PDP, AM.CL protocols and Courier patch
    + New macros: remote_mta, smtp_response, remote_mta_smtp_response
      and score_boost available to log and notification templates
    + Enhanced regexp selector macro [~string|regexp|then|else], and
      iterator macro.  Extended the semantics of the regexp selector macro
    + Make use of the new macro remote_mta_smtp_response and add it to
      a default $log_templ, so that a Postfix queue-id of a forwarded
      message shows up like 'queued_as: DCF2A17B9E4' in the main log entry
    + sophos_savi_internal (SAVI module): don't include errno ($!) in the
      error message
  * Bump standards version to 3.7.2 (no changes required)
  * Add small debian/extract-upstream-en_US-templates.pl to help manual
    update of debian/etc/en_US/, add update-templates-from-upstream target
    to debian/rules
  * amavisd-new.postinst: abort configuration if the amavis user has an
    invalid home directory, and tell the local admin to fix the mess
    as we cannot do it safely by ourselves (closes: #367807)
  * conf.d/25-amavis_helpers (add): configure an unix socket by default,
    for the amavis-release helper (closes: #372122)
  * amavisd-release: modify default socket location to Debian's
  * amavisd-new.NEWS: note upstream incompatible changes from RELEASE_NOTES
    for version 2.4.1

amavisd-new (20030616p10-5) unstable; urgency=high

  Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>:
    * Fix su invocation on cron.daily script.  Why can't su have a less
      braindead command line interface? (closes: #281931)
    * Let message/external-body through.  I just hope that no Micosoftland
      trash will auto-run, auto-process, auto-overwrite files and otherwise
      endanger the sanity of a Unix sysadmin out there because of this...
      (closes: #274940)
    * Backport a few improvements for spamassassin 3.0 from amavisd-new 2.x
    * Patch from Mark Martinec <Mark.Martinec@ijs.si> (upstream):
      patch against amavisd-new-20030616-p10 required to detect some
      password-protected RAR archives as ***UNCHECKED***
      (There are viruses using encripted RAR files as a carrier on
      the wild)
    * Suggest using only "undef" for false, but I cannot duplicate the
      problem with sid's perl (closes: #269449)

amavisd-new (20030616p10-4) unstable; urgency=high

  Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>:
    * Backport do_ascii fixes from 2.1.1.  This makes sure we call
      Convert::UUlib::CleanUp() no matter what, to avoid empty temporary
      files clogging up on ${TMPDIR} when UUlib fails for some reason (which
      is quite common unfortunately).  This patch may also avoid leaking
      UUlib state for the next decode, but whether this actually can happen
      is unclear (since we call UUlib::Initialise all the time).
      I have kept the backport to the minimum, so the stat -> lstat change 
      from 2.1.1 was not backported.
    * Add workaround for when Convert::UUlib fails to decode something that
      it thought it could (such as a procmail recipe!).  Now, do_ascii will
      create an empty file as a placeholder for the non-decoded part.  This
      deals with #268100, but it is not clear to me who is at fault here, so
      I am not reassigning the bug back from libconvert-uulib-perl, nor
      closing it yet.

    * Mention LDAP schema location in README.Debian.  As for how to use
      amavisd-new with LDAP, well, someone needs to write the docs, and send
      them in ;-) (closes: #261691);
    * Fix stupid locale-related bug in rfc2822 date generation, where we
      were restoring the saved LC_TIME value to LC_CTYPE (!)
    * Override LC_TIME to "C" on every log message, to work around issues
      with Unix::Syslog (closes: #256248);
    * Remove perl 5.8.0 taint+encode bug workaround in safe_encoding, it is
      corrupting the encoded string (closes: #234934);
    * Add clamav-daemon recommendations from NEWS.Debian to README.Debian
      too.  I still want to find a way to get this thing to work out-of-
      the-box;
    * mlfi_abort is called every time something causes sendmail to stop a
      delivery (such as a RSET in the ESMTP dialogue, or a dropped
      connection).  This indicates no problem with amavisd-new-milter, and
      such aborts are expected from time to time.  Therefore, log at the
      debug level, and not as a warning (closes: #255203).

      don't append spam address extension, and don't quarantine
      NOTE: the documentation still describes former behaviour
    * report deaths of command line scanners and some external programs
      distinctly from normal exits with nonzero exit status
    * fix replacing * or {}/* in the pattern with actual file names
    * stop the timer after SMTP transaction is over
    * sub mail_via_smtp_single: properly report SMTP response code when all
      recipients are rejected by MTA
    * use SMTP response code 554 (instead of 550) for rejecting syntactically
      invalid header (according to rfc2476)
    * add am_id to SMTP response code generated by one_response_for_all()
      to make it easier for MTA log to be correlated with amavisd-new log;
      some cosmetic improvements in the generated SMTP response text
    * added 'Return-Path:' in notifications to make it more obvious to see
      envelope address from reports
    * fix 'Message-ID:' in neutral DSN notifications being inadvertently
      pushed into the DSN body
    * report undefined spam score in X-Spam-Status header field as 'hits=-'

    * added virus names: tanatos, lentin, bridex
    * set environment variables LINES and COLUMNS to sensible defaults
    * another attempt at fixing the Subject header field duplication
    * rewritten 'Received' header fields parsing to better cope with valid,
      as well as with more common cases of broken syntax; used when trying
      to report originator IP address for believed-to-be-faked senders
    * more permissive parsing of SMTP addresses and options on MAIL FROM
      and RCPT TO commands
    * 'neutral' (=space) field in SQL black/whitelists now terminates the
       lookup
    * $sa_mail_body_size_limit takes into account some portion of the mail
      header size
    * don't send recipient notifications to recipients that have
      bypass_virus_checks/bypass_banned_checks
    * fetch modules 'Net::Ping' and 'bytes', which seem to be needed in
      certain chrooted setups
    * change log level from 0 to 1 for the log entry 'BAD HEADER from',

    * explicitly set pipes and sockets to binmode, as it a default sinc
      Perl 5.8.1

    And people wonder why I (hmh@d.o) want to kill all helpers, and support
    SMTP-proxy mode only for amavisd-new... (closes: #203545)
  * Add cron.d job, run every 3 hours, to rebuild SpamAssassin databases
    (if spamassassin is installed) for the amavis user, and to force-expire
    tokens once per day.  If you have more than one thread of amavisd-new
    running, spamassassin really needs a rebuild often
  * Add configurable spamassassin timeout (sa_timeout), and set it to 120s
    instead of upstream default of 20s (which IS too small) (closes: #204101)
  * Ship LDAP schema for amavis in /etc/ldap/schema/amavis.schema
  * Add pidfile hack and syslog support for amavis-milter.c
  * Add syslog support for amavis.c
  * Improve header folding: it now uses tab (as everything else in the MTA
    world) instead of spaces to indent lines
  * Better Received: line creation in milter/amavis socket mode (if it is
    enabled for whatever reason)

amavisd-new (20021227p2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tweak postinst a little so that we still try to warn users about a
    non-system amavis user if adduser fails
  * Set unarj unpack command to first try arj, then unarj.  Keep suggesting
    only arj, since unarj is not in main
  * Add back to logcheck ignore file a few error messages that are common to
    the normal running of amavisd-new. logcheck is to trap unusual
    circunstances.  It is a conffile, so if you don't want some lines, just
    kill them and they will NOT be added back...  Brian is way too nice
    sometimes :-)
  * Fix logcheck.ignore entries that were missing the queue id (and thus would
    never match), thanks to Martin F. Krafft for the heads-up
  * I don't want to know how the submitter managed to lose the override, but
    silent breakages are no fun anyway.  Bang out with an error message
    instead (closes: #183421)

amavisd-new (20021227p2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Hey, I forgot to look at the BTS in p1-2" release
  * New upstream patch "p2": fixes missing sender notification for banned
    filenames, improves helper-progs configure/make, and adds minor tweaks to
    SAVI-Perl interface and to amavisd.conf
  * Uploaded to unstable, nobody complained about anything in experimental
  * Since at least 20021227p1-2, we depend on libdisgest-md5-perl, this work
    fine for both current unstable and stable, and that's all that matters
    (closes: #178030)
  * The new initscript from 20021227p1-2 fixed this issue (closes: #176624)
  * We work fine without any AVs in upstream 20021227p1 (closes: #162273)
  * We support only the Direct-MTA-Mode (SMTP/LMTP proxying) now (simpler, and
    just as fast for anything but sendmail, which isn't fast anyway to begin
    with -- switch to postfix or exim if you need speed).  SMTP proxy mode
    shouldn't ever create looping bounces in non-broken configurations: You
    should NOT pipe any locally-generated bounces through your content scanner
    in the first place (trivial to do with postfix, I don't know about exim).
    Also, there's no <<>> borkage in amavisd-new in proxy mode, since the
    shell is not used anywhere.  Thus, I believe we can close the bug
    (closes: #159042)
  * This is the new upstream version (closes: #176859)
  * Now you can properly configure amavis to REPLACE the address extension
    instead of appending it, which will fix this issue (closes: #178613)
  * Move regular do_ascii output to loglevel 4
  * Rebuilt logcheck.ignore files with most of the level 0 messages, ignoring
    those that are used only by the socket clients (closes: #176692)
  * Reworked package description to reflect the fact that we are a SMTP
    proxy, and don't support the non-SMTP clients anymore (support IS still
    in the code, and will work if enabled)
  * Install to debian/tmp and use dh_movefiles.  It is neater this way,
    especially if building inside a CVS tree

amavisd-new (20021227p1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Cleanup debian/* for lintian and linda-cleaness, and arch all
  * Add myself to uploaders
  * Spamassassin support is runtime-selectable, so now we ship with a default
    "@bypass_spam_checks_acl = qw( . );" (i.e. disabled), and we can move
    spamassassin to Suggests
  * Move nomarch to Suggests, since all other unpackers are there
  * Add libdigest-md5-perl to Depends: for better woody compatibility
  * Switch to debhelper mode 4, since we have a initscript (invoke-rc.d)
  * Rewrite most of the initscript so as to have it far more robust
  * Rename init script to /etc/init.d/amavis
  * Support ephemeral /var/run, do not ship /var/run/amavis in the deb anymore
  * Rework postinst to be a bit more resilient on the adduser part, add
    versioned dependency to adduser 3.34 or better
  * Make postrm indepondent, by not failing if parts of what we want to remove
    aren't there anymore
  * Updated and modified package description a bit
  * Wrote amavisd(8) manpage
  * Moved config files to /etc/amavis/
  * Easy-to-localize template system for the notifications,
    in /etc/amavis/<lang>, using the new read_text support
  * Add pt_BR localization
