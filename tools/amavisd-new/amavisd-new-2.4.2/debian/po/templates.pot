"The Debian packages have changed the way they handle configuration files for "
"amavisd-new to a better system, which uses multiple files instead of a "
"single, monolithic file."

"The old amavisd-new configuration files that are still present in your "
"system (named either /etc/amavisd.conf or /etc/amavis/amavisd.conf) are "
"incompatible with this new config file layout."

"You should read /usr/share/doc/amavisd-new/README.Debian to understand the "
"new configuration layout, and after that you should port your configuration "
"to the new layout."

"For your safety, the old configuration files in your system have been "
"disabled, and a \".disabled\" postfix was added to their file names.  The "
"amavisd-new service will refuse to start until you remove (or rename) these "
"\".disabled\" files."

"This safety is in place to avoid starting an unconfigured amavisd-new in "
"place of your previously configured one.  Do not remove the \".disabled\" "
"files until you have read the /usr/share/doc/amavisd-new/README.Debian file "
"and ported your old configuration to the new layout."
