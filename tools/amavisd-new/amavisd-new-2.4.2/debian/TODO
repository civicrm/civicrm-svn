TODO for the packages in experimental (the rest of this file might apply
 as well):

* Manage all this with UCF, so that we get three-way diffs. Keep
  *all* shipped revisions to enable intelligent three-way diffs.
  (?)

* Enhance amavisd-new clamd builtin support init to detect when clamd
  ain't there?

* Update templates to the new ones. pt-BR is outdated for sure
* Improve locking on milter to lock before fork, use the new code
  in rng-tools mt.3 or above
* get rid of berkeley-db?
