Saved Search User Interface and Logic.

Search Tabs:
- Basic Search
- Advanced Search
- Browse Saved Search

Browse Saved Searches.
This operation will be displayed as a tab - "Browse Saved Search"
It will use a selector / pager to display list of saved searches.
Fields displayed will be

Name:
Description:
formValues (converted to basic english):
links for [run], [remove], [edit].

The 'run' link will execute the Saved Search query.
'remove' will delete it from database
'edit' will open the edit form.

(currently there is no search area in this tab for searching "saved searches" but it will be implemented in future)



Other issues that need to be resolved.

1 - Can Advanced search screen be made more obvious of the AND/OR's between
    the different elements ?

2 - Need to have an english sentence representation of the Advanced Search query
    that shld be stored at the form level and can be displayed with the results.
    (thx dgg for the great tip.).
