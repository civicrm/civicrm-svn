/**
 * This is where hook functions go for standalone installations
 *
 * If you're familiar with the hook design pattern, or the Drupal concept,
 * this should all be pretty familiar to you.
 * 
 * See http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/CiviCRM+hook+specification
 * for more information on hooks and what they do.
 *
 * Hook function names should all start with "standalone_". So in the
 * documentation where you see "hook_", replace that with "standalone_".
 * See the example below for more details.

/* Example hook function definition
